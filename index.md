ELF License Family
========================

# About ELF
ELF stands for "ELF License Family" (yes, it is a recursive acronym).
The ELF License Family was created to enable communities to create stories and fictional worlds together.
The licenses are based on the Creative Commons licenses.
Under each license in the ELF License Family, the creator of a work retains copyright, and others are allowed to create and distribute derivative works for commercial or non-commercial purposes.
Each license also requires that credit is given to the creator.
Additional stipulations are included for each license.

# The Licenses

The ELF-BY-SA 1.0 license allows reproduction and distribution of the licensed work, in addition to derivative works.
This license is intended to be used by those who want to create something that can be shared by everyone.

## ELF License Family Attribution ShareAlike NoReproduction 1.0 International Public License
The ELF-BY-SA-NR 1.0 license does not allow reproduction and distribution of the licensed work.
This license is intended to be used by those who prefer to retain the rights to distribute their work.
The motivation for this option is to facilitate works that require a large amount of money to create, such as a movie or video game.
While the rights to reproduction are restricted, others can still create and distribute derivative works.
